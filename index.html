                                Hello! My name is Saloni Purswani. I‚Äôm an aspiring software engineer, and a senior at <a href="https://drexel.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science. I enjoy learning about and building creative software that ultimately makes a task feasible or easier.

                                <br>
                                Through my academics, my focus has been on Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.  I‚Äôm fascinated by AI, ML and other emerging technologies and how they have created room for engineers to innovate. 
                                HCI personally draws me in because I believe user experience is more important than it ever has been, as the look & feel and performance can mean all the difference in an app's success. 
                                To focus on my two areas of interest, I‚Äôm currently working to learn and apply cloud technologies to applications and front-end frameworks to new projects.

                            When I‚Äôm not working on software or attending class, my time at Drexel is usually spent pursing my interests in two organizations: <a href="http://drexelwics.hosting.acm.org/" class="link" target="_blank">Drexel Women in Computing Society</a> (WiCS) and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NaachAtPenn/" class="link" target="_blank">PENNaach</a>. 
                            I have been involved with WiCS since 2016 and currently am the VP of Public Relations for the 2020-2021 school year. 
                            WiCS is a strong, empowering community that celebrates women in tech, and offers the opportunity for students to make connections and learn about pursuing their interests in the field. 
                            WiCS‚Äô mission speaks to me and I‚Äôm glad help other girls like me, in navigating the tech industry.
                            <br><br>
                            Since 2017, I have been a dancer and choreographer on PENNaach, a female South-Asian fusion dance team.
                            Every year in February, my team and I put on a themed show with about 10 performances of various styles. 
                            This platform has not only provided me the ability to express myself through dance, 
                            but has also given me my greatest friends and the opportunity to evolve personally. 
                            Through PENNaach, I can be creative with my choreography, lighting, music and costumes, and also learn what it means to oversee a project from start to finish. 
                            Below are a few pictures from our last show and photoshoot.
